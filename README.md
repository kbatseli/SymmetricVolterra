Enforcing symmetry in tensor network MIMO Volterra identification
------------------------------------------------------------------

MATLAB implementation to reproduce the results in the article `Enforcing symmetry in tensor network MIMO Volterra identification'


1. Functions
------------

* experiment.m

Runs this script to reproduce the resulst reported in the "Enforcing symmetry in tensor network MIMO Volterra identification" article. The occurence of measurement noise can be toggled by setting NOISE_ON to either 0 or 1. 

* IncreasingD_experiment.m

Run this script to reproduce the result in the "A Khatri-Rao product tensor network for efficient symmetric MIMO Volterra identification" article.
